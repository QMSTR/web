      <description>Node labels are used to flexibly add data to nodes based on key-value pairs. For example, if a build process consists of multiple stages, a label can be used to mark nodes with the stage during which they are created. Or a target program generated during the build could be marked with a release milestone name. The labelling functionality allows for user-defined concepts to be flexibly represented in the knowledge graph.</description>
