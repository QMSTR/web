Quartermaster is a community building project as much as it is a
technical one. The idea to collaboratively build FOSS compliance
tooling that is itself free and open source software has raised
interest that has almost been overwhelming for us (in a good
way). With these development updates, we want to inform our quickly
growing community of contributors and partners about what has been
achieved so far, and where development is headed next. Most
importantly, these updates will present the opportunitities to
collaborate with us, and to contribute to and help the project
forward. Please consider this an open invitation.

# First development preview of the Quartermaster prototype

We just published the current state of the [Quartermaster
prototype](https://github.com/QMSTR/qmstr-prototype). It showcases the
first building blocks of what Quartermaster instrumentation of builds
will look like - a master process, running adjacent to the build,
collecting meta-information about the software being built, using a
REST API to communicate with the build, reporters and integration with
external systems.

## Code first
The code is work in progress. As we speak, we continue developing
it. The next sprint focuses on CI integration, demonstrated using
Jenkins. We are organising development in sprints of 2 weeks, and will
schedule a community hangout at the end of the sprints that are open
to everybody. You are invited to collaborate with us on Quartermaster
in all the usual ways - provide feedback, raise issues through Github,
or send pull requests our way. It may be too early to look into using
Quartermaster in production, but it is never too early to influence
where it is going and what functionality it provides.

## Roadmap: proof of concept, prototype, version 0.1

During the summer, we developed a proof of concept that demonstrated
how builds can be instrumented to gather compliance information. This
proof of concept was shown at a couple of conferences and meetups. Based
on this experience and the feedback we got, the current prototype was
planned. It will be developed in three sprints, and then be used to
define the requirements for the first generally usable version of
Quartermaster, known as "version 0.1". Our roadmap looks like this:

* prototype sprint #1, Nov 22 - Dec 5, 2017: done and published.
* prototype sprint #2, Dec 6 - Dec 19, 2017: in progress.
* prototype sprint #3, Dec 20, 2017 - Jan 16, 2018: upcoming (this
sprint lasts 4 weeks to account for the end of year holidays).
* version 0.1 requirements definition workshop: January 17, 2018 (see
  below for an invitation). At the workshop, we will review that we
  learned from the development of the prototype, and lay out the plans
  for what the first version should look like in a collaborative
  fashion.
* development sprints towards version 0.1: January 17 - April 10,
  2018.

## Everyone, get in here!

As you seen from the roadmap, there is plenty of opportunity to
contribute to Quartermaster. Besides collaborating directly on the
project on Github, here are two exquisite community events to
participate in:

* The sprint #2 demo community hangout will take place Dec 20, 2017 at
  16:00 CET.
* The version 0.1 requirements definition workshop will take place
  January 17, 2018, from 10am to 5pm, at the Endocode office on
  Berlin. It is open to all interested parties, however there are only
  30 seats available. To request an invitation, please submit a
  request through the [contact form on the Quartermaster web
  site](http://qmstr.org/contact/). Or reach out to us on
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fosscompliance), direct messages are
  open. Or call the [Endocode
  office](https://endocode.com/impressum/), or send us a letter in the
  mail. There is really no reason not to try.

To stay in touch with the project, please consider these options
(links to them are on top of the [Quartermaster web
site](http://qmstr.org/):

* Follow the [@fosscompliance](https://twitter.com/fosscompliance)
  Twitter account.
* To receive regular announcements like sprint reports or invitations
  to community hangouts, request to be added to the newsletter [using
  the contact form](http://qmstr.org/contact/). We promise to keep the
  volume of announcements low and relevant, and not to use your data
  for any other purpose.
* Star [Quartermaster on Github](https://github.com/QMSTR/) to follow
  development.

The next prototype development update will be sent once sprint #2 is
complete.
