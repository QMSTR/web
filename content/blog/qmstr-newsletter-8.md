Spring is coming, and so is Quartermaster v0.1! One more sprint to get
there. Sprint 5 saw the implementation of initial support for Gradle
based Java projects, a finished definition of the reporting API, the
introduction of "easy mode" (see below), improved author detection and
more steps towards an automated HTML reporter. Sprint 5 was the last
roud of new features before Quartermaster v0.1 will be wrapped up for
release. We will use the final sprint in this quarter to tie up loose
ends, polish, containerise, document and demonstrate, and to prepare
the v0.1 release. The first milestone will be concluded with the v0.2
requirements workshop on April 11.

# Reporting API refactored, implemented in HTML reporter

The elemental workflow from construction to analysis to reporting has
become more and more defined throughout the development of version
0.1. In sprint #4 we defined the analysis API, which was a dependency
for the reporting API. Both are defined as gRPC interfaces to the
master. This makes module-side implementations in different
programming languages a possibility, since modules always are run as
separate processes by the master.

Keeping the administrative effort to run a build in Quartermaster low
and simple is a key goal for us. With the flexibility of the phased
workflow toolchain comes some setup effort to configure how the
modules (running in separate processes) communicate with the
master. This may sound simple enough for now, however to scale larger
Quartermaster deployments, it may be necessary for the modules to run
distributed over different machines. Or, depending on the build
environment, the whole Quartermaster deployment could run in a
Kubernetes cluster and execute the modules in nodes. Quartermaster is
prepared for such scenarios. To simplify the client side setup, this
sprint introduced a first version of "easy mode", a simple command
line tool that when used to run a build step, automatically sets up
the process environment so that the build step knows how to
communicate.

It is as easy as that, which is why we call it "easy mode". Real-life
setups may not always be as simple, but it really helps. Also,
by default the `qmstr` command will clean up temporary file system
ressources before closing, so it simplifies setup and teardown of the
environment. This will be a very central tool in the Quartermaster
arsenal. It may learn how to set up the environment for a Python based
analysis module, for example. Easy mode is still work in progress, and
comes with a big fat warning when it starts. Feel free to try it.

## Plans for the upcoming (final v.01) sprint

There is one more sprint before the first Quartermaster milestone is
completed. The Quartermaster project is organised into milestones that
always span one quarter. Within each milestone, there are six sprints
that last 2 week each. At the end of every sprint there is a public
demo on Wednesday at 4pm CET (or CEST). At the end of the milestone,
there is always a requirements workshop for the coming milestone that
is open to the whole community. If you are interested in joining, get
in touch through one the open communication channels with the project:

<br />

We will use the final sprint to prepare the v0.1 release. There won't
be many new features added. Instead, we will make everything work,
containerise the demo setups to make them more easily reproducable,
deploy them in a public CI instance and start publishing the results
on the Quartermaster web site. We may even add some documentation :-)
After milestone 1, Quartermaster is ready for interested developers to
try out and experiment with. In the spirit of Open Source, we release
"early and often", so this version is still rough around the edges and
probably not yet ready for production use.

## And finally ... plans for milestone 2?

The technical requirements for milestone 2 will be developed during
the requirements workshop on April 11. There are some higher level
goals we would like to start working on setting up a legal advisory
committee to the project that will help making sure that the documents
generated by Quartermaster are useful to reduce uncertainty in license
compliance scenarios. And we plan to start working closely with
interested communities and vendors to support their workflows and
environments. We believe that by the end of milestone 2, Quartermaster
should be ready for production use in some scenarios, like packaging
applications for app stores or embedded devices.

And we presented Quartermaster at the [BCS Open Source
Specialist Group](http://ossg.bcs.org/) hosted event on [Yanking the
Chain: Open Source Software Compliance in the Supply
Chain](http://ossg.bcs.org/blog/2018/02/15/yanking-the-chain-open-source-software-compliance-in-the-supply-chain-london-22-3-2018/)
on March 22 in London. People seem to have enjoyed it. There are
Quartermaster bubbles on screen!
