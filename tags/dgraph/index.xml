      <description>&lt;p&gt;We hope you are ready for some fireworks as we kick of the development
of the first Quartermaster version that aims for general
availability. The goal for this sprint, after we wrapped up prototype
development in the previous one, was to establish all the building
blocks that will make the Quartermaster toolchain. They are based on
the new system architecture developed at the requirements workshop on
January 17, and based (but developed from scratch) on the learnings
from the prototype. At the end of the sprint, we had a working
Quartermaster again, with some fancy graph visualisations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
