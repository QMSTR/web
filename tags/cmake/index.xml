      <description>&lt;p&gt;The third Quartermaster prototype development sprint also marked the
end of development of the Quartermaster prototype. Our main goal for
the prototype was to work with our partners and collaborators to
develop an approach to FOSS compliance automation that delivers
correct and complete results in a variety of use cases. The
integration of new build systems has been tested, the workflow phases
have been refined and abstracted further and limits of the prototype
design identified. We wrapped up the sprint with a workshop where the
functionality of the prototype was evaluated and the findings applied
to a draft architecture of the first production release of
Quartermaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
