      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels great when a plan comes together. After the requirements
workshop on January 17, the Quartermaster team had a pretty good
understanding of what the architecture of the toolchain should look
like. Two weeks into development, we now see that the design is solid,
and that the runtime phases and modular analysis and reporting
concepts work well. The details of the architecture will be explained
in an upcoming blog post. Right now, we are making good progress
towards a working system. The &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; demo was extended, we added the
&lt;code&gt;qmstr-cli&lt;/code&gt; tool to manage the master, and set up the first internal
CI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
